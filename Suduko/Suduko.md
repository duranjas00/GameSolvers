## Suduko 

-How fast can I get a program to solve suduko? 

### Important info/to-dos
-get harder puzzles and test on those
-puzzle1 resorced from https://norvig.com/sudoku.html 
-add tests for puzzle format
-come up with idea if base case dosent work



- Instead of using tulpe notations, convert row/col to indices. This will stop from having to iterate through the whole board to find matchinf notation. 
- Each row, column and square should be  equal to 9! (45). 
- input suduko board / define playing grid
- Create array for each empty space, fill with possiblities, if a square only has one possiblity then fill in that number etc.
